# Decision Log

Decisions and rationale for the health plan.

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Status |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 2025-02-11 | Target weight: 175–190 lb | Mortality-optimized BMI for 55yo male at 5'11" is ~24.5–27 (Flegal JAMA 2013, Global BMI Mortality Collaboration Lancet 2016, 2024 meta-analysis). Lighter is not better after 50. | Active |
| 2025-02-11 | Primary metric: waist-to-height ratio < 0.50 | WHtR is the strongest single anthropometric predictor of cardiometabolic risk and mortality (Ashwell & Hsieh 2013, Nature Int J Obesity 2023). For 5'11" = waist < 35.5 in. | Active |
| 2025-02-11 | Prioritize lean mass over scale weight | Sarcopenia accelerates after 50 (1–2% muscle loss/yr). Low muscle strength independently predicts mortality regardless of BMI (Volaklis 2018). Resistance training is non-negotiable. | Active |
| 2025-02-11 | Target body fat: 15–20% | WHO healthy range for men aged 50–59. Captures composition quality that BMI misses. Sarcopenic obesity (low muscle + high fat at "normal" BMI) has worst outcomes. | Active |
