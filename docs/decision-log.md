# Decision Log

Decisions and rationale for the health plan.

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Status |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 2025-02-11 | Target weight: 175–190 lb | Mortality-optimized BMI for 55yo male at 5'11" is ~24.5–27 (Flegal JAMA 2013, Global BMI Mortality Collaboration Lancet 2016, 2024 meta-analysis). Lighter is not better after 50. | Active |
| 2025-02-11 | Primary metric: waist-to-height ratio < 0.50 | WHtR is the strongest single anthropometric predictor of cardiometabolic risk and mortality (Ashwell & Hsieh 2013, Nature Int J Obesity 2023). For 5'11" = waist < 35.5 in. | Active |
| 2025-02-11 | Prioritize lean mass over scale weight | Sarcopenia accelerates after 50 (1–2% muscle loss/yr). Low muscle strength independently predicts mortality regardless of BMI (Volaklis 2018). Resistance training is non-negotiable. | Active |
| 2025-02-11 | Target body fat: 15–20% | WHO healthy range for men aged 50–59. Captures composition quality that BMI misses. Sarcopenic obesity (low muscle + high fat at "normal" BMI) has worst outcomes. | Active |
| 2025-02-11 | Reduce cardio from 300+ to ~150 min/week | Diminishing returns above 150 min/week (Arem, JAMA 2015). 150 min/week captures ~80% of mortality benefit. Freed time goes to resistance training. | Active |
| 2025-02-11 | Shift cardio from Zone 4 to Zone 2 | 150 BPM at age 55 is ~91% max HR (Zone 4). EXCITE Trial (Circulation 2016) showed moderate-intensity exercise produced equal collateral vessel growth (+41%) vs high-intensity (+39%). Zone 2 (~120-135 BPM) is safer and allows better recovery. | Active |
| 2025-02-11 | Weights before cardio | Cardio before weights suppresses mTOR/hypertrophy signaling (Murlasits 2018, Schoenfeld 2014). Interference effect most pronounced when cardio is >30 min. Flip the order. | Active |
| 2025-02-11 | Replace situps with anti-extension/rotation core work | Repeated spinal flexion under load increases disc herniation risk (McGill 2010). Pallof press, dead bugs, planks, farmer's carries are safer and more effective. | Active |
| 2025-02-11 | Upper/Lower split, 4 days/week | Hits each muscle 2x/week (superior to 1x for hypertrophy — Schoenfeld 2016). Fits 4-5 day schedule with one cardio/recovery day. 10-15 sets/muscle/week. | Active |
| 2025-02-11 | Progressive overload via double progression | Current weights too light (25 lb press, 75-95 lb leg press). Use rep range target: hit top of range → increase weight 5-10 lb. Even 90-year-olds gain strength with progressive loading (Fiatarone, NEJM 1994). | Active |
