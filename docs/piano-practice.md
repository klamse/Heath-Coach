# Piano Practice: Evidence-Based Guide

Research-based recommendations for an adult learner (55, 1.5 years experience).

## The Big Takeaways

1. **60 minutes of focused practice > 2 hours of unfocused practice** — total time does not predict outcome (Duke 2009)
2. **You're spending too much time on exercises** — shift from 50-75% exercises to ~20%, and spend ~70% on repertoire
3. **Split sessions beat single long sessions** — two 45-min sessions with sleep between them outperform one 90-min session
4. **You may be at the normal 1-2 year plateau** — this is temporary and well-documented in adult learners (Rogenmoser 2024)
5. **A teacher is one of the highest-leverage investments** at your stage

## Duration: Is 2 Hours Better Than 1?

### What the Research Says

Ericsson's landmark study (1993) on elite violinists found:
- Best performers practiced **3.5 hrs/day in 3 sessions of 80-90 min max**
- "Essentially **no benefit from durations exceeding 4 hrs/day** and reduced benefits from practice exceeding 2 hours" per session
- Effective deliberate practice "may be closer to **1 hour per day**" for many learners

### Diminishing Returns

| Duration | Assessment |
|----------|-----------|
| 30 min/day | Sufficient for slow, steady progress |
| **60 min/day** | **Optimal for most adult learners** |
| 90 min/day | Good if split into 2 sessions (45+45) |
| 2 hrs/day (single session) | Diminishing returns — concentration degrades after 45-90 min |

### Split Sessions Are Superior

- Ericsson's best violinists used **multiple shorter sessions with rest**, not marathons
- Distributed practice outperforms massed practice (d=0.42 effect size — Donovan & Radosevich 2001)
- **Sleep between sessions** produces a 20% motor speed improvement that wakefulness does not (Walker, Neuron 2002)
- Two 45-min sessions (morning + evening) likely outperform one 90-min session

### Evening Practice Has a Slight Edge

Practice in the evening, closer to sleep, shows better motor skill consolidation than morning practice (Brawn 2023). If you can only practice once, evening may be slightly better. If you split sessions, put your **most technically demanding new material in the evening session**.

## Exercises vs. Repertoire: You Need to Flip the Ratio

### Your Current Split

| Activity | Your Current % | Recommended % |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Exercises (7th chords in all keys) | 50-75% | **15-25%** |
| Repertoire work | 25-50% | **50-65%** |
| Sight-reading / new material | — | **10-15%** |
| Review / play-through | — | **5-10%** |

### Why Less Exercises, More Repertoire

**Transfer of learning is limited for isolated exercises.** Research (Palmer & Meyer 2000) found that the greatest transfer occurs when you learn technique *within the context of actual music*, not in isolation. Practicing chord voicings through all 12 keys develops familiarity, but the motor and cognitive context differs substantially from encountering those chords in real pieces.

**What to do with your chord exercises:**
1. **Reduce to 10-15 min** per session (not 30-45 min)
2. **Rotate keys across days** rather than all 12 every session
3. **Connect to repertoire** — if your piece is in Bb, warm up with Bb chords and progressions
4. **Extract technical passages from pieces** and use those as your "exercises"

### Are Exercises Bad?

No — but they become counterproductive when they:
- Consume so much time that repertoire is shortchanged
- Are practiced on autopilot (repetition without engagement)
- Aren't connected to the music being learned
- Become a form of **avoidance** — exercises feel safe and measurable, while pieces feel harder and more vulnerable

## What Makes Practice "Deliberate"

The Duke et al. (2009) study is the most important finding here. They had piano majors learn a Shostakovich passage. **Total practice time did not predict performance quality.** What the best practicers did differently:

1. **Identified the exact location and source of each error** — not just "that sounded wrong" but which note, which finger, which beat
2. **Corrected errors immediately** — did not play through hoping they'd self-correct
3. **Slowed down strategically** — decelerated right before the error point without stopping
4. **Varied tempo systematically** — slow to get it right, then speed up to test
5. **Practiced with musical expression from the start** — did not add dynamics/phrasing later
6. **Included "thinking time"** — silent pauses to analyze the score, sing, make pencil marks
7. **Repeated target passages until the error was absent** in subsequent trials

### Deliberate Practice Requires (Ericsson 2016):

- A **well-defined, specific goal** for each session (not "practice Chopin" but "nail the left-hand voicing in measures 12-16 at 80 BPM cleanly")
- **Full concentration** — it should feel mentally taxing
- **Immediate feedback** — you must hear and assess each attempt
- **Systematic error correction** — identify exactly what went wrong and fix it
- **Working at the edge of current ability** — not too easy (autopilot), not too hard (flailing)

## Evidence-Based Practice Strategies

### Interleaved Practice (Don't Grind One Thing)

Carter & Grahn (2016) found that **interleaved practice** (alternating between pieces every 3-5 min) produced better retention than blocked practice (20 continuous minutes on one piece).

- It *feels* less productive — you don't see the same in-session improvement
- But it produces **better long-term retention** because the brain must repeatedly reconstruct the motor plan

**Apply this:** Rotate between 2-3 passages or pieces every 3-5 minutes rather than grinding one thing.

### Slow Practice — But Not Only Slow

- Slow practice works because it allows **accurate motor pattern encoding** (Jancke 2004)
- But **only slow practice is insufficient** — alternating between slow and target tempo is more effective
- Best micro-strategy (Duke 2009): **slow down right before error points** without stopping

### Variable Practice

Schmidt's Schema Theory (1975): practicing with variations builds more robust motor skills than fixed repetition.

Once you can play a passage, practice it:
- At different **tempos** (slower, faster)
- With different **dynamics** (piano, forte)
- With different **articulations** (legato, staccato)
- With **rhythmic variations** (dotted rhythms, reversed dotted)

### Mental Practice

fMRI shows imagining playing piano activates **the same brain networks** as actual playing (Meister 2004). Even 5-10 min of studying the score away from the piano — hearing the music internally, visualizing hand positions, analyzing harmonics — contributes to learning.

### Chunking

- Break passages into segments of **1-4 beats** (0.5-5 seconds)
- The harder the passage, the smaller the chunk
- Practice chunks individually, then chain them together
- **Whole-part-whole:** play through → identify problem spots → isolate and drill → reintegrate

### Record Yourself

- Listen back weekly — you'll hear errors you miss while playing
- Evaluating from the "teacher's perspective" improves self-regulation (Miksza 2015)

### Keep a Practice Journal

Musicians who set **specific goals** for each session learn more efficiently (McPherson 2019). Each entry:
- What you worked on
- What the specific goal was
- What went well
- What still needs work
- What to focus on next session

---

## Get a Teacher

The research consensus: **a teacher is one of the highest-leverage investments at your stage.** Even biweekly lessons with daily self-practice using teacher-assigned goals would be significantly more effective than self-teaching alone.

Why:
- Provides **immediate expert feedback** — the most critical component of deliberate practice (Ericsson)
- Self-taught pianists tend to **repeat errors without identifying them**, compounding bad habits
- Identifies **technique problems** (posture, hand position, tension) that are invisible to the learner
- Structures the **progression of difficulty** appropriately

## The 1-2 Year Plateau Is Normal

Research on older adult piano learners (Rogenmoser 2024) found a characteristic pattern:

1. **Early rapid progress** (months 1-6)
2. **A frustrating plateau** (often around 1-2 years) where progress feels stalled
3. **Accelerating gains** once foundational skills are internalized

**You may be in or approaching this plateau right now.** It is temporary. The foundations you're building (chord knowledge, finger independence, reading) will unlock faster progress once they're internalized. Consistent, deliberate practice through the plateau is what separates those who advance from those who quit.

## Adult Learner Advantages

You have real advantages over child learners:

| Advantage | How It Helps |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Analytical ability** | Grasp music theory, harmonic structure, and patterns faster |
| **Emotional depth** | Richer musical interpretation from the start |
| **Metacognition** | Can plan, monitor, and adjust your own learning |
| **Intrinsic motivation** | Choosing to learn produces more sustained engagement |
| **Life experience** | Understanding that progress is nonlinear and requires patience |

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Perfectionism** — spending too long making one passage "perfect" before moving on. Get it approximately right, then space review across days.
2. **Too much time on exercises** — they feel safe; pieces feel vulnerable. Lean into the discomfort.
3. **Comparing to children or professionals** — irrelevant and damaging to motivation.
4. **Neglecting tension** — adults are more prone to strain. Warm up, monitor tension, take breaks.
5. **Not using a teacher** — adults may feel embarrassed, but a teacher accelerates progress dramatically.
6. **Autopilot repetition** — mindless repetition without focused attention is not practice.

## Sample Practice Sessions

### 60-Minute Session

| Time | Activity | Principles |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 0-5 min | **Warm-up:** Stretching + scales/arpeggios in keys of current repertoire | Contextual technique; injury prevention |
| 5-15 min | **Technical work:** Chord exercises or passages extracted from pieces; rotate keys across days | Transfer of learning; interleaved across days |
| 15-40 min | **Repertoire (deliberate practice):** 2-3 pieces, alternate every 3-5 min. Identify errors → isolate → slow down → fix → reintegrate | Interleaving; error correction; chunking |
| 40-50 min | **Sight-reading:** Play through something unfamiliar at a comfortable tempo | Reading fluency; breadth |
| 50-58 min | **Play-through:** A previously learned piece start to finish for enjoyment | Consolidation; motivation |
| 58-60 min | **Journal:** What went well, what needs work, goals for next session | Self-regulation |

### 90-Minute Split (Recommended)

**Morning Session (45 min)**

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 0-5 min | Warm-up: stretching + scales in repertoire keys |
| 5-15 min | Technical exercises (chord work — rotate keys) |
| 15-40 min | Repertoire: deliberate practice on Piece 1 and Piece 2 (interleaved) |
| 40-45 min | Quick journal entry |

**Evening Session (45 min)**

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 0-5 min | Brief warm-up |
| 5-30 min | Repertoire: most technically demanding new material (evening = better sleep consolidation) |
| 30-40 min | Sight-reading or exploring a new piece |
| 40-45 min | Play-through of a piece you enjoy + journal entry |

## Realistic Expectations at 1.5 Years

With consistent 1-hour daily practice and instruction:
- Comfortably playing **early intermediate repertoire** (easier Bach Minuets, simplified classical, folk songs with chord accompaniment)
- Working knowledge of **major/minor scales**, basic chord progressions
- Developing **two-hand independence**
- Beginning to play with **musical expression** (dynamics, phrasing)
- Full proficiency at intermediate pieces (e.g., complete Fur Elise, easier Chopin waltzes) typically takes **3-5 years** of consistent adult practice
