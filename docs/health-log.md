## Tips

- **Weight:** Weigh daily but only look at the **weekly average**. Daily swings of 1–3 lb are normal.
- **Waist:** Only measure every 2–4 weeks. Same spot (at navel), same time (morning).
- **Exercises:** Use shorthand — e.g., "GB Squat 50x10, RDL 65x12, Leg Press 180x12"
- **Supplements:** Use abbreviations — "C,W,D,O,M" for a full day, or note what was missed.
- **Print tip:** In Excel, select all data → File → Print → set to Landscape, Fit to 1 page wide.

## Weekly Review

Every Sunday, review the week:
1. What was my average weight this week vs. last week?
2. Did I hit 160g protein most days?
3. Did my lifts go up (progressive overload)?
4. How was my energy and sleep?
5. Any adjustments needed?
