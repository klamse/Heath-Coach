# Health Plan

Priorities and action items for optimizing health, vitality, energy, and mental clarity.

## Current Stats (2025-02-11)

- **Age:** 55
- **Height:** 5'11" (180 cm)
- **Current weight:** ~200 lb
- **Target weight:** 175–190 lb (BMI 24.5–27)

## Target Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Priority |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Weight | ~200 lb | 175–190 lb | Medium |
| Waist-to-height ratio | TBD | < 0.50 (waist < 35.5 in) | **Highest** |
| Waist circumference | TBD | < 35.5 in (90 cm) | High |
| Body fat % | TBD | 15–20% | High |
| Lean muscle mass | TBD | Maintain/build | **Highest** |

### Priority Order (for longevity)

1. Waist-to-height ratio < 0.50
2. Muscle mass & strength (resistance training)
3. Body fat 15–20%
4. Scale weight 175–190 lb

## Scoring Matrix

Goals scored 1-10 on three criteria:
- **Value** (10 = high value)
- **Ease/Cost** (10 = easy/low cost)
- **Risk of Success** (10 = low risk)

Total = sum of three scores (max 30)

## Goals

| Goal | Value | Ease/Cost | Risk of Success | Total | Status |
|------|-------|-----------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| Reduce waist-to-height ratio to < 0.50 | 10 | 6 | 7 | 23 | Not started |
| Build/maintain lean muscle mass | 10 | 6 | 7 | 23 | Not started |
| Reach 15–20% body fat | 9 | 5 | 6 | 20 | Not started |
| Reach 175–190 lb | 7 | 5 | 6 | 18 | Not started |

## Key Research Findings

- **Overweight BMI (25–30) has lower all-cause mortality than normal BMI after 50** (Flegal, JAMA 2013; 2.88M people)
- **The "obesity paradox" disappears when waist circumference is used instead of BMI** — it's about visceral fat, not total weight
- **Sarcopenia (muscle loss) is a major mortality driver after 50** — losing 1–2% muscle mass/year without intervention
- **A muscular 190 lb man at 18% body fat is healthier than a sedentary 170 lb man at 25% body fat**

## Action Items

- [x] Define initial health goals
- [ ] Baseline current health metrics (measure waist, estimate body fat %)
- [x] Research evidence-based weight targets
- [ ] Design resistance training program
- [ ] Design nutrition plan for body recomposition
- [ ] Set up regular tracking in health-log.md
