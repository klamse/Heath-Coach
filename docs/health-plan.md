# Health Plan

Priorities and action items for optimizing health, vitality, energy, and mental clarity.

## Current Stats (2025-02-11)

- **Age:** 55
- **Height:** 5'11" (180 cm)
- **Current weight:** ~200 lb
- **Target weight:** 175–190 lb (BMI 24.5–27)

## Target Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Priority |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Weight | ~200 lb | 175–190 lb | Medium |
| Waist-to-height ratio | TBD | < 0.50 (waist < 35.5 in) | **Highest** |
| Waist circumference | TBD | < 35.5 in (90 cm) | High |
| Body fat % | TBD | 15–20% | High |
| Lean muscle mass | TBD | Maintain/build | **Highest** |

### Priority Order (for longevity)

1. Waist-to-height ratio < 0.50
2. Muscle mass & strength (resistance training)
3. Body fat 15–20%
4. Scale weight 175–190 lb

## Scoring Matrix

Goals scored 1-10 on three criteria:
- **Value** (10 = high value)
- **Ease/Cost** (10 = easy/low cost)
- **Risk of Success** (10 = low risk)

Total = sum of three scores (max 30)

## Goals

| Goal | Value | Ease/Cost | Risk of Success | Total | Status |
|------|-------|-----------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| Reduce waist-to-height ratio to < 0.50 | 10 | 6 | 7 | 23 | Not started |
| Build/maintain lean muscle mass | 10 | 6 | 7 | 23 | Not started |
| Reach 15–20% body fat | 9 | 5 | 6 | 20 | Not started |
| Reach 175–190 lb | 7 | 5 | 6 | 18 | Not started |

### Progressive Overload — How to Increase Weight

Use the **double progression method**:

1. Pick a weight you can do for the **bottom** of the rep range (e.g., 8 reps)
2. Use that weight until you hit the **top** of the range (e.g., 12 reps) for all sets
3. Increase weight by **5 lb** (upper body) or **10 lb** (lower body)
4. Drop back to the bottom of the rep range and repeat

**Example:**
- Week 1: Dumbbell bench press 40 lb x 8, 8, 7
- Week 3: 40 lb x 10, 10, 9
- Week 5: 40 lb x 12, 12, 11
- Week 6: Increase to 45 lb → 8, 8, 7 ... repeat

### Phase-In Plan (first 8 weeks)

| Weeks | Focus | Intensity | Cardio |
|-------|-------|-----------|--------|
| 1–2 | Learn movements, light weight | RPE 5–6 (easy, focus on form) | 20 min post-weights |
| 3–4 | Build comfort, moderate weight | RPE 7 (3 reps in reserve) | 15 min post-weights |
| 5–8 | Begin progressive overload | RPE 7–8 (2–3 reps in reserve) | 15 min post-weights |
| 9+ | Full program | RPE 8 (2 reps in reserve) | 15 min post-weights |

**Deload:** Every 4–6 weeks, reduce volume by ~50% for one week to let your body recover.

## Cardio Plan

### Why the Change

| | Old Plan | New Plan | Rationale |
|--|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Volume** | 300+ min/week | ~150 min/week | 80% of mortality benefit at 150 min (Arem, JAMA 2015) |
| **Intensity** | Zone 4 (~150 BPM) | Zone 2 (~120–135 BPM) | Equal collateral vessel growth at moderate intensity (EXCITE Trial 2016) |
| **Timing** | Before weights | After weights | Eliminates interference effect on muscle growth |
| **Purpose** | Primary exercise | Complement to resistance training | Combined training = 40–46% lower mortality vs either alone |

### Coronary Collateral Circulation

Exercise stimulates **collateral blood vessel growth** in the heart — dormant vessels enlarge up to 20x, creating natural bypasses. Key findings:

- Patients with well-developed collaterals have **36% lower mortality** (Meier, European Heart Journal 2012)
- Moderate-intensity exercise produces **equal collateral growth** to high-intensity (EXCITE Trial, Circulation 2016)
- The new plan (~150 min/week) still **exceeds research thresholds** for collateral development (3–5x/week, 30+ min, 60%+ capacity)

### Weekly Cardio Schedule

| Day | Duration | Intensity | HR Target |
|-----|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Mon (after Upper A) | 15–20 min | Zone 2 | 120–135 BPM |
| Tue (after Lower A) | 15–20 min | Zone 2 | 120–135 BPM |
| **Wed (cardio day)** | **30–45 min** | **Zone 2** | **120–135 BPM** |
| Thu (after Upper B) | 15–20 min | Zone 2 | 120–135 BPM |
| Fri (after Lower B) | 15–20 min | Zone 2 | 120–135 BPM |

**Weekly total: ~110–145 min** (meets AHA/ACSM 150 min guideline when including warm-ups)

## Key Research Findings

### Weight & Body Composition
- **Overweight BMI (25–30) has lower all-cause mortality than normal BMI after 50** (Flegal, JAMA 2013; 2.88M people)
- **The "obesity paradox" disappears when waist circumference is used instead of BMI** — it's about visceral fat, not total weight
- **Sarcopenia (muscle loss) is a major mortality driver after 50** — losing 1–2% muscle mass/year without intervention
- **A muscular 190 lb man at 18% body fat is healthier than a sedentary 170 lb man at 25% body fat**

### Resistance Training
- Each muscle group **2x/week** is superior to 1x for hypertrophy (Schoenfeld 2016)
- **10–15 sets per muscle/week** is the optimal dose-response range (Schoenfeld 2017)
- **60–80% of 1RM** produces greatest strength gains in older adults (Peterson 2010)
- Even **90-year-olds** gain significant strength with progressive resistance training (Fiatarone, NEJM 1994)

### Cardio & Heart Health
- **150 min/week** captures ~80% of maximum mortality benefit (Arem, JAMA 2015)
- **Moderate-intensity cardio grows collateral vessels as well as high-intensity** (EXCITE Trial, Circulation 2016)
- **Combined cardio + resistance = 40–46% lower all-cause mortality** vs. either alone
- **Resistance training itself improves blood pressure and lipid profiles** (Cornelissen & Smart, JACC 2013)

## Nutrition (Brief)

- **Protein target:** 145–200 g/day (1.6–2.2 g/kg) — higher end recommended for older adults due to anabolic resistance
- **Caloric deficit:** 300–500 kcal/day for sustainable fat loss (~0.5–1 lb/week)
- **Protein distribution:** 30–40 g per meal across 4+ meals/day
